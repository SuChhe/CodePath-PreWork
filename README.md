## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** This is fantastic; I have always wanted to develop a mobile app and this experience was wonderful.
Since this was first mobile dev experience, I donâ€™t have much to compare - but this was as good as any other dev experience I have had - i was hooked.

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** ArrayAdapter maps the item on the screen to an Array at the back and provides necessary functions to add / delete / replace an item from the array to emulate corresponding user actions on the screen. 
I have not used the getView/convertView methods yet.

## Notes

- I have done a development of this nature after a long time.
- I have done Android development for the first time; so I had to spend lot of time than I expected.
